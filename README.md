## Description

Production files for a single-page responsive website, using [use-init](https://github.com/use-init/init) as the initial boilerplate. 
The structure has been slightly tweaked to acommodate the project and development team needs.

Since it as parallax website, this website heavily relies on [*skrollr*](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr) to manage most paralax animations.

[*Bower*](https://github.com/use-init/init) is used to manage the vendors used in the project.
